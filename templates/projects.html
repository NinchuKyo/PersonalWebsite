                            The reasoning as to why I undertook this project to create
                            a personal site was to showcase the various projects that had
                            worked on before, and to show what skills I can bring to a
                            potential person or organization.

                        <b>Technologies Used</b>
                        <p> 
                            This site is hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), using
                            an EC2 instance. Web page requests / responses are handled
                            by the Apache module <a href="https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">
                                mod_wsgi</a> as the interface for 
                            <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> 
                            (a Python micro web framework) responsible for processing
                            requests received and returning the appropriate web pages.
                            The front end framework used is
                            <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>,
                            which allows for a Bootstrap-like ease-of-use, but
                            with a different flavour.
                        </p>
                        <b>Design Decisions</b>
                        <p>
                            Originally, this site was hosted on Heroku, but I
                            then chose to switch over to AWS due to constraints
                            present on Heroku's free tier, which made it for
                            web applications must sleep for 6 hours / day.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
                    <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
                        <p>
                            With Heroku, the features provided made it easy to deploy
                            web applications as it could pull from GitHub
                            automatically whenever a commit was made, and the
                            fact that I did not have to worry about setting
                            up Apache, or configuring security settings. 
                            However, what I wanted was full uptime without having
                            to worry if my site was down, and for payment
                            to be as a per-use basis, instead of a flat fee
                            on Heroku.  The other bonus was gaining the
                            knowledge of how to deploy simple web applications
                            using AWS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flask was chosen as a web framework due to its simplicity
                            as it comes with the bare essentials for making a web
                            application (not needing a lot of boilerplate code to get
                            the job done), and the ability to get a small site like
                            mine with minimal features up and running in no time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to use Materialize for my front-end framework
                            as I wanted something that looked stylish, but different
                            as to what Bootstrap had offered, which was responsive
                            web design. What really impressed me about Materialize
                            was the use of <a href="http://materializecss.com/cards.html">
                            cards</a>, which I felt was perfect for displaying
                            little tidbits of information, but giving a bit of
                            insight on what the card was about through the card image.
                            If a person wanted to know more about the card topic, then
                            links could be provided below the card, just like what the
                            cards on the home page accomplished by taking you to this
                            page (if you used them to get to this page).

                    </div>
                </div>

                <!-- _Note -->
                <div id="note" class="row container section scrollspy">

                        <p>
                            _Note was actually a university course project that
                            I cooperated with five other classmates to make. We
                            named it _Note, as the blank could stand for whatever
                            you needed it to be used for, be it for students needing
                            to store and access their synced notes from a desktop
                            or mobile iOS device, or a busy professional on the
                            go for mobile only.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the time, my classmates and I were introduced to an
                            app called Evernote, and were amazed at how it could be
                            used seamlessly across a multitude of devices.  So we
                            thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could make
                            something like that?", and thus became the inception of
                            _Note.
