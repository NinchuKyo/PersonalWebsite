                            The reasoning as to why I undertook this project to create
                            a personal site was to showcase the various projects that had
                            worked on before, and to show what skills I can bring to a
                            potential person or organization.

                        <b>Technologies Used</b>
                        <p> 
                            This site is hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services), using
                            an EC2 instance. Web page requests / responses are handled
                            by the Apache module <a href="https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">
                                mod_wsgi</a> as the interface for 
                            <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> 
                            (a Python micro web framework) responsible for processing
                            requests received and returning the appropriate web pages.
                            The front-end framework used is
                            <a href="http://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>,
                            which allows for a Bootstrap-like ease-of-use, but
                            with a different flavour.
                        </p>
                        <b>Design Decisions</b>
                        <p>
                            Originally, this site was hosted on Heroku, but I
                            then chose to switch over to AWS due to constraints
                            present on Heroku's free tier, which made it for
                            web applications must sleep for 6 hours / day.
                        </p>
                    </div> 
                    <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
                        <p>
                            With Heroku, the features provided made it easy to deploy
                            web applications as it could pull from GitHub
                            automatically whenever a commit was made, and the
                            fact that I did not have to worry about setting
                            up Apache, or configuring security settings. 
                            However, what I wanted was full uptime without having
                            to worry if my site was down, and for payment
                            to be as a per-use basis, instead of a flat fee
                            on Heroku.  The other bonus was gaining the
                            knowledge of how to deploy simple web applications
                            using AWS.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Flask was chosen as a web framework due to its simplicity
                            as it comes with the bare essentials for making a web
                            application (not needing a lot of boilerplate code to get
                            the job done), and the ability to get a small site like
                            mine with minimal features up and running in no time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to use Materialize for the front-end framework
                            as I wanted something that looked stylish, but different
                            as to what Bootstrap had offered, which was responsive
                            web design. What really impressed me about Materialize
                            was the use of <a href="http://materializecss.com/cards.html">
                            cards</a>, which I felt was perfect for displaying
                            little tidbits of information, but giving a bit of
                            insight on what the card was about through the card image.
                            If a person wanted to know more about the card topic, then
                            links could be provided below the card, just like what the
                            cards on the home page accomplished by taking you to this
                            page (if you used them to get to this page).
                        </p>
                        <b>Future Project Plans</b>
                        <p>
                            The great thing about persuing this project is the
                            potential for improvements. In the future,
                            I'm thinking of maybe adding a blog section about
                            video games and technologies so I can discuss my
                            thoughts and opinions about them. By doing so, I hope
                            to improve my writing ability for professional
                            purposes.

                            _Note was actually a university course project that
                            I cooperated with five other classmates to make. We
                            named it _Note, as the blank could stand for whatever
                            you needed it to be used for, be it for students needing
                            to store and access their synced notes from a desktop
                            or mobile iOS device, or a busy professional on the
                            go for mobile only.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the time, my classmates and I were introduced to an
                            app called Evernote, and were amazed at how it could be
                            used seamlessly across a multitude of devices.  So we
                            thought, "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could make
                            something like that?", and thus became the inception of
                            _Note. Due to the size of this project, each member
                            had a specific role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the project, my role involved anything that was 
                            iOS related. This meant that my main goal were 
                            getting the iOS design and development up and running,
                            utilizing the testing frameworks for iOS, and making
                            sure that it would work with our server design. I
                            felt that this was an interesting challenge as
                            before this, I had never worked with iOS app development
                            nor using Objective-C.

                        <b>Technologies / Methodologies Used</b>
                        <p>
                            Considering that this project involved more than
                            one person, we needed a means of managing ourselves
                            and how software development should be done.  For
                            the software development methodology, Agile was used.
                            We used <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> as our
                            Kanban board for user stories and feature planning. 
                            The project lasted for three iterations, with each
                            iteration being about two to three weeks long.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The web framework / back-end used for _Note was Flask
                            and hosting was done through AWS using an EC2 instance 
                            (the same as what was used for this website), but instead
                            of the standard responses returning static html pages,
                            _Note uses a REST-style architecture for its responses, 
                            where they are made in JSON in order to support both
                            desktop browsers and mobile applications. MVC was the
                            driving software architecture on how the application was
                            structured. For version control, Git was used, with
                            GitHub used to host our Git repository for everyone
                            on our team to access.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The front-end desktop browser client design was done
                            using a bit of custom CSS, Bootstrap, and AngularJS. 
                            For the mobile application, which was an iOS application,
                            Objective-C, with the Cocoa framework was used. Storyboards
                            were used to manage the multiple view controllers, like
                            having a slide-out menu for the list of notes, and a view
                            to load the note's content when a list item is tapped.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note storage was handled by using the user's Dropbox
                            account that they allowed the application to store
                            notes via 
                            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/oauthguide">OAuth</a>,
                             which was handled by the
                            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core">
                            Dropbox API</a>. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For testing the desktop browser client, 
                            <a href="https://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a> was used for
                            unit testing, and <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">
                            Selenium</a> was used as the acceptance testing framework.
                            As for the iOS client, we used 
                            <a href="https://github.com/kmalakoff/QUnit.m">
                            QUnit for iOS</a>, and for acceptance testing, we used
                            <a href="http://www.testingwithfrank.com/">Frank</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <b>Design Decisions</b>
                        <p>
                            In this case, Flask was chosen for this project, as
                            before this, we had never used Python or Flask for
                            back-end web development and decided as a group that
                            we wanted to try it out.  In terms of only making
                            an iOS application and not an Android application
                            as well, was that it was not required by the
                            course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When we were wondering what technologies to use for
                            the desktop browser front-end, one of the members of
                            our team had experience working with AngularJS and
                            Bootstrap. Since none of the other members had used
                            this before, we wanted to learn more about it.
                            I feel that one of the best ways to learn something
                            new is to leverage someone else's knowledge, as they
                            went through the process of learning it, so they
                            would know the in's and out's of the technology and
                            how to do things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since none of us had worked with mobile development
                            technologies, we just went with what was recommended
                            to us in the class. It was certainly a different
                            experience compared to what I had been used to
                            programming with C#, especially with the use of
                            NS prefixes in the language, and how to manipulate
                            objects and variables. Use of the storyboard felt
                            similar to Visual Studio's WinForms, so I felt
                            it was pretty easy to get used to.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            In terms using the Dropbox API to store a user's
                            notes through Dropbox, we felt that based on our
                            application being related to notes accessibility
                            and modifications across different platforms,
                            we felt that this the perfect technology to use.
                            Originally, we wanted some form of syncing across
                            platforms. However, writing code that handles
                            syncronization is extremely difficult. Instead,
                            we thought about how Dropbox was able to sync
                            files across platforms, so maybe we can somehow
                            leverage it to store and sync notes, and sure
                            enough they had an API which we could use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the testing framework that we chose to use,
                            we just went with the ones we felt was easier to use,
                            and the ones that were recommended to us.
                            In class, we were recommended a couple of options
                            for which testing frameworks to use. For acceptance
                            testing for the browser, we had the option of
                            using <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>
                             or Selenium, and as noted above, we went with 
                            Selenium.
                        </p>
                        <b>Lessons Learned</b>
                        <p>
                            Overall, I felt that from doing this project, I
                            learned a lot on how programming in a larger
                            group can be difficult sometimes, and what ends
                            up happening a sometimes were communication
                            issues, where one member doesn't communicate
                            to others what they are doing, resulting in
                            duplicated work or end goals aren't communicated
                            clearly enough, resulting in wasted work.
                            Having went though this experience taught me
                            greatly on the value of effective communication
                            and the impact it could have when working with
                            a team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes there are moments where there
                            were disagreements, but a great mentor that I had
                            the pleasure of working with imparted me with some
                            great advice, which was, "At the end
                            of the day, you just brush it off and don't take
                            anything said against you personally". A part of
                            being a software developer is listening to
                            different opinions and being able to acknowledge
                            how others think and to "walk a mile in their
                            shoes".
