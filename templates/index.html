                        <p class="flow-text">A bit about myself... My interest in
                            software development began with a simple passion for
                            gaming.  I've always wondered how it was possible for one
                            to make such an immersive environment that could pull one
                            in for hours and hours.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Not only limited to making video games,
                            the potential for software to recreate the world through
                            innovation, creativity, and experimentation is what is
                            going to keep me passionate about this field today and
                            for the future days to come.
                        </p>

                            with a passion for gaming, you've come to the right place!
