# Personal Website

Hello!

My name is David Nguyen and this is the code for my personal / professional
website.

On it, you can find various details about myself such as my hobbies,
previous projects, code samples, and how to contact me.

This site is hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using an EC2 instance, and it
uses the Apache webserver, using [mod_wsgi](https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/) 
to host the python application responsible for handling the page requests.

The back-end web framework used is [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) 
with python, and for the front-end, the [Materialize framework](http://materializecss.com/)
is used. 

You can find my site at [here](http://davidnguyent.com).
